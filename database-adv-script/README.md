SQL Joins Practice
This project demonstrates using different types of SQL joins with a sample Airbnb-like database. The queries are included in joins_task.sql.

Included Queries
✅ INNER JOIN
Retrieves all bookings and their respective users. Returns only records where a booking is linked to a user.

✅ LEFT JOIN
Retrieves all properties and their reviews. Includes properties even if they don’t have reviews.

✅ FULL OUTER JOIN
Emulates a full outer join by combining a LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN with UNION, returning all users and bookings—even when they don’t match.

File
joins_task.sql — Contains the three SQL queries demonstrating INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.
